I use postcrypt to send **encrypted postcards**. Handwriting an entire postcard is painful for me, typing is much easier.

## Problem
If I send an e-mail the recipient can read it immediately. I still want the excitement of receiveing a postcard in the mail and reading it, associating the text you're reading with the image on the card.

## Solution
Encrypt the postcard text with a simple password. Send the encrypted text via email, send the password via postcard. Viola - encrypted postcards.

* Go to [https://etherealmachine.github.io/postcrypt/encode.html](https://etherealmachine.github.io/postcrypt/encode.html)

  * I suggest something composed of 3-5 words, based on the where you're sending the postcard from
  * Like, "queentowerbridge"
* Draft your email
* Hit the button and encode your text!
* Copy/paste the encoded text into an email
  * Make sure to get everything or it might not decrypt properly!
* Write the password down on a postcard and send it to your friend
